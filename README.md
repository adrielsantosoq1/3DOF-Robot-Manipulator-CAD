## Features
- 3 revolute joints enabling basic manipulator motion 
- Fully constrained CAD assembly 
- Detailed part design adhering to class specifications 
- Kinematic sketches to visualize joint movements

## Usage 
1. Open the CAD files in SolidWorks or another compatible CAD software. 
2. Explore the assembly and individual components. 
3. Review the included drawings and PDFs for dimensions and design details.

## Notes
- Completed as part of the Drawing CAD class final project. 
- Designs follow the instructorâ€™s specifications for educational purposes. 
- All CAD files are included for review, analysis, or replication.
